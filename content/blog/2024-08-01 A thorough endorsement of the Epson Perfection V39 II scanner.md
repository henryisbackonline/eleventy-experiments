The scanner in question. One of the better things I’ve bought.

This is really what it says on the tin. The Epson Perfection V39 II is the best scanner I’ve ever used, and it suits my needs perfectly. It has high resolution, fast operation, and is incredibly simple and straightforward. Admittedly, I could have bought a [feed-through scanner](https://www.amazon.com/Epson-Workforce-ES-C220-Document-Scanning/dp/B0C8VKWMDR?ref_=ast_sto_dp&th=1) instead of this flatbed model as I mostly scan documents and receipts, but I plan to do some photo scanning and restoration at some point, which this flatbed model will be more suitable for. But I digress. If you need a good scanner, then **buy this one**. I have it linked below if you want it. For anyone who wants to know more about why I recommend this so thoroughly, please keep reading. This won't be a long one, I promise.

## Scan Quality

Truly, this takes some of the best scans I’ve ever seen. I mostly scan at 300dpi for documents and 600dpi for photos, but this goes all the way up to *4800dpi* — far more than most people will ever need. This amount of resolution is plenty for all the document and photo scanning that I’ve done so far and has proven to be more than enough for my needs. However, I must add a disclaimer: **this is not the best option for film scanning.** If you need to scan film slides or originals, a better option would be the [Perfection V850 Pro](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00OCEJMG8?ref=emc_p_m_5_i_atc&th=1). However, for scanning printed photos or documents, I can still thoroughly recommend the V39 II.

## Ease of Use

This thing is so damn simple it’s almost frustrating. You plug it in, install the software it comes bundled with (which I’ll discuss shortly), and press the “scan” button. And it just works. There’s no need to fiddle with anything to start scanning at all, no weird drivers to install, no ancient websites to download abandonware from, and no third-party software needed for it to operate at its full potential (at the time of writing at least). In fact, the hardest thing about using this scanner is getting it off the shelf I store it on. This has been the most hassle-free peripheral I’ve ever used (aside from my external SSD), and I continue to be pleasantly surprised by how user-friendly it is.

## Software

Here’s where the magic happens. I haven't talked a lot about the hardware, because, well. I mean. It’s a *scanner*. They’re a solved problem as far as hardware goes, and there’s precious little in terms of technical innovation these days. But the software is a different story. So many peripherals in this family of scanners/printers/office accessories have such godawful software that feels like it was developed in the 2000’s and abandoned after that. Epson’s software (at least Epson ScanSmart) feels *modern.* It feels *new.* It feels like they put time and effort into developing simple, useful, useable software, and I really appreciate them for it. You plug the scanner in, launch ScanSmart, and press either the “SCAN” button in ScanSmart or the scanner itself. Without having to fiddle or customise anything, you get high-quality scans out of the box, which you can save as any kind of picture- or document-oriented file format (even PDFs with OCR). The software can automatically detect what you’re scanning and customise its settings to suit.

Epson ScanSmart home screen. I love the big button in the middle that says “SCAN”. Really sets the tone.

But beyond the automatic scanning, there’s the customisation, which is incredibly straightforward. You can easily choose the scan settings to optimise for documents or photos, and you can customise those settings beyond there. I have two custom document settings: one for greyscale and one for colour.

The various settings optimisations. I often use document mode because I often scan documents.

The custom settings I have set up for document scanning. I pick the one I need based on the weather, mostly.

I’ve turned off the photo enhancements because they haven’t been helping a whole lot. But they’re there if you want to use them, and the option is at least nice to have.

Photo enhancements. Perhaps they’re helpful for some, but I prefer to make any touchups myself.

Once the scan is complete, ScanSmart gives you options on where to save your scans. I appreciate the plugins to the various cloud services (OneDrive is the only one I actually use), but what I appreciate even more is that you can turn these off and prioritise the ones you want to keep. Options like this really go a long way in improving the user experience. It’s the small things, man.

The save actions customisation screen. Thank god for this, and Epson too.

Being able to customise the file name is really helpful. I’m a huge fan of this, because on the off chance that I don’t immediately rename a scan, I can at least get an idea of what it is and when it was created just by looking at the title.

![[07 IMG_8409.PNG]]
There’s nothing I can really add to this. It’s a file name. There’s not a huge amount to be excited about.

The save settings let you decide how compressed your compressed file formats (pdf and jpeg) should be. I have these at maximum un-compression because I am a data hoarder, and I truly have nothing better to use all the space in my hard drive for. Honestly, the default compression settings should be fine, and there’s really no need to play around with these unless you’re also a data hoarder and want to preserve as much detail in your scans as you possibly can.

![[08 IMG_8410.PNG]]
I set everything to minimum compression. There’s no need for any sensible person to do the same.

After getting past all the settings and finally scanning a document, the options you have here are honestly perfect for pretty much everyone. Beginning the scan is straightforward — just press the big “SCAN” button.

The initial scanning process. I love that button.

You can add pages to the scan by pressing the small “+ Scan” button in the top right corner of the page view.

Adding more pages to the original scan.

There are four buttons on the main scan screen: Delete, Rotate right, Crop, and Stitch Images.

![[11 1_GQzqZGSYEAbkOkPuKEE4tQ.png]]!

Three of these are fairly self-explanatory. “Delete” deletes the selected page, “Rotate Right” rotates the selected page to the right, and “Crop” lets you crop the selected page. You can choose a freeform crop, stick to the original aspect ratio, or choose one of the pre-set fixed ratios.

“Stitch Images” is very quickly becoming my favourite button on here. For long documents that don’t fit entirely in the scanner bed, you can scan portions of them and stich them together. There are two options: basic stitching or smart stitching. Basic stitching just sticks the scans together in whatever order and orientation you determine, but smart stitching looks for objects in the images to align, and stitches based on that alignment. I use smart stitching to put together my longer receipts so they don’t span multiple pages, and instead are one long PDF.

Using the “Basic Crop” function to align and merge the two scans.

Once you’re happy with the result, pressing “Next” in the bottom right corner will take you to the save screen. From there, you can rename the file, choose the file format (use “Searchable PDF” when scanning documents as this will let you save them with optical character recognition (OCR) turned on), and choose the location to save your document.

This is software is fairly barebones, but it's ideal for pretty much everyone’s needs. That’s what I like so much about this scanner, really. Everything it does and all the ways it works are designed to be as consumer friendly and approachable as possible, without cramming too many extra features in. There’s some customisability for all those who want it, but for most people, they’ll never have to touch that stuff. For those who want to do even more, this scanner is very well supported by several third-party programs such as [VueScan](https://www.hamrick.com/), [NAPS2](https://www.naps2.com/), and [Scanner by Simon Knuth](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9N438MZHD3ZF?ocid=pdpshare). You can’t go wrong, really.

This ended up being much longer than I thought it would be, but for a piece about a *scanner* of all things, I think it turned out alright. I hope that I’ve convinced you buy one of these as soon as you think you might need a scanner for whatever reason. They come in handy more often than you’d expect. I’ve linked it once more at the bottom of this paragraph for anyone who wants to buy it. Happy scanning!
