Prior to this post, I wrote about how I make purchases. Upon reflection, that post wasn’t accurate at all. It doesn’t reflect how I work, how I think, or how I act. In fact, it was little more that some strange idea I had late at night, and, for whatever reason, I decided that it was a wonderful and thought-provoking thing to publish.

Frankly, that post was stupid. I hated it. So I removed it.

The whole goal for this blog, as I say in my [about page](https://henryisonline.pika.page/about), is for me to develop a healthier relationship with the internet. Part of that goal is to pay more attention to what I say on the internet, and how I say it. The post I removed did not reflect that goal **in any way**. It was little more than a longform shitpost, which is exactly the kind if content I *don’t* want to produce.

I have done enough shitposting. 

There’s enough slop out there for anyone who wants it. I stepped away from social media and into the [blogosphere](https://xkcd.com/802/) to get away from it, and also to reduce my desire to contribute to it. That’s not to say that everything I make here will be some [huge think piece or ground-breaking revelation](https://henryisonline.pika.page/posts/on-blogging-and-social-media), but it will be more thought out and more carefully considered than what I would otherwise post on social media. 

Anyway. All that is to say, I’m working on it. Part of the process of getting myself off social media is to learn how to think though what I publish. In a time where sharing every idle thought has become normal (and expected in some cases), putting more time and consideration into my writing feels worthwhile to me. 

Thank you for reading. It means a lot.
