A little while ago I took a trip to Nepal, and I took my Fujifilm X-T30 II with me. I’ll probably write more about that at some point, but in the meantime, I saw something interesting in my photos. One of my photos has a small part of the left side of the image stitched onto the right side. This is exactly as it came out of the camera, both on the RAW and the JPEG image. I imagine it must be related to me taking photos in burst mode, but beyond that, I have no clue why this happened.

The two photos below show the difference between the normal image and the weird one.

Behold, the jpegs:
- the normal one

- the weird one

See that strip on the right? That’s the left side of the image, just stuck there. I have no idea what caused it. I mostly just thought it was an interesting little camera glitch.
