I take **too damn long** to buy things.

That’s probably good, considering that a lot of what I buy at this point in my life is expensive and serves a specific purpose, like cameras and printers and computer monitors. I like to think that I spend a lot of time researching purchases, comparing prices, and deciding what to buy and *exactly* when to buy it, but most of my time is actually spent flagellating about the thought of spending more than $100 on something (much to the frustration of *everyone* who knows me).

However, this has a really good side effect: **I’ve rarely made a purchase I regret.** There are some, particularly when I’ve been in a hurry and needed something quickly, but most of the time I make pretty sound purchasing decisions (or at least I think so). While my purchases are ultimately worthwhile and tick most, if not all, the boxes, my decisions are based on something that’s frankly **pretty fucking stupid.** Folks, I present to you my decision matrix for spending money: the Wojak Bell Curve.

*Jesus Christ, I’m hopeless.*

This goddamn diagram has ~~ruined~~ ~~benefited~~ heavily impacted pretty much every purchasing decision I’ve made since about late 2023. Currently, it’s influencing my decision about buying BluRays (*I like physical media, sue me*). At one end, there’s standard BluRays; no 4K, no Dolby Atmos, just a standard 2K BluRay disk. In the middle, we have Native 4K UHD discs with HDR10 and Dolby Atmos which are original rescans by Criterion Collection. And on the right, we’ve got standard BluRays once again.

There’s *much* more nuance to a lot of my decisions than just the Bell Curve (*shocking, I know*), but it often boils down to that. For BluRays in particular, **the player often matters more than the disk**, not to mention the screen you’re viewing it on.  For that reason, a standard BluRay disk will be ***plenty*** for pretty much anyone. That’s not to say that UHD disks aren’t worth it — there are *plenty* of movies that I’m planning on buying in UHD because they have a particular meaning to me. However, it’s worth considering your needs as a consumer (and it’s particularly important to distinguish between *wants* and *needs* here), and for whatever reason, this stupid diagram helps do that for me. 

It’s not limited to purchasing decisions either. In fact, one of my main flagellations at the moment is [deciding where I actually put this blog on the internet.](https://henryisonline.pika.page/posts/regarding-websites-and-writing) I know, *fundamentally*, that Pika is an easier way to manage all of this (left and right sides if the Curve). However, I’m enchanted by self-hosting and static site generators (middle of the Curve), and at the moment I think that’s a better long term goal. The initial setup will be hard, but ultimately I get to keep the workflow that I like and use the tools that I want. While this doesn’t conform *exactly* to the Bell Curve, it nonetheless influenced my decision-making process and left me with a result that I feel good about.

Jeez, this was a strange one to make. It came to me in a dream, and I just *had* to get it down. Anyway, I sincerely hope that no-one else gets whatever brain worm I evidently have, and that you can live a normal life without this stupid internet comic mentally flashbanging you every time you want to click “Buy Now”. 

Have a good day folks.

*I’m enjoying writing so much at the moment. I know I wrote a [little while back](https://henryisonline.pika.page/posts/hello-again) about writing every day, but that’s definitely unreasonable for me. Once a week, however, seems pretty good. I’ll try to keep that pace up going forward. No promises though.*
