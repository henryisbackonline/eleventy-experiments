I’m experimenting with GitHub, and so far it’s going _fine_. Not great really, or bad either. Just _fine_. That’s the nature of learning and experimenting I suppose.

I had vscode, terminal, and github open all at once, and tried to do things with all of them. Don’t do this if you treasure your files.

*My Git history. I've cherry picked the hairiest and weirdest bit of it specifically because I think it's funny. I made a lot of mistakes here. Whoops.*

I also made a new face for my face. This image has become important to me, if only because it’s funny and I like it.

The face for my face

*The profile picture I’m slowly putting everywhere. It’s a scrawled approximation of my face in a cartoon style, where the right side of the mouth, right eye, and tip of my nose extend beyond the boundary of the right side of my face. The expression is mostly blank, but the mouth shows something akin to puzzlement. My eyes are off centre, and I looks a bit daft, to be frank. That really is the point of it though - it’s a caricature.*

Got a new job too, and it’s going well. I’ll have to update my now page, which I’d link here except that Pika’s editor is a bit cumbersome on mobile. As far as creating a post goes though, it’s really easy to use this platform. I think I need to draft my posts in here instead of anywhere else.

> I like it here. It feels peaceful.

Cat. But you knew that already.

## How does this thing work again?

This, beyond anything, is an experiment. Not only an experiment about using this website and if I like it, but if I like blogging and writing in general.

I think I do. I like writing, and I think as far as writing goes, this is the best place to share it socially.  I’m pretty tired of microblogging on social media, and I want a space where my stuff lives. 

A blog sounds good and practical, especially since I want to write more than I want to post photos or videos. Maybe a static site generator like [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) might be better. Maybe. Anyway.

Wonderful monospaced font. 
Running a website seems hard, and I'd much rather someone else do it.
```

The biggest thing that I need is to reduce the friction between myself and writing. Putting words on the page is the goal. A website and its inner workings can come later, for now I just need to write more. Maybe I’ll do one of those “write something once a week” challenges.

Ah well. lots of solutions to problems that I may not even have. For now though, I’m back.

There's some magic in photography.](https://pika.page/rails/active_storage/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NTAxNDgsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--a816cc6797217c56c6eb71453787b6174a0b6aae/IMG_4511_banner.jpeg)
